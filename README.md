## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (A version control system is a repository that allows you to save versions of a file on your computer, go back to old versions, and merge versions together.)
2. (Git is a special type of version control system because it takes snapshots of all the versions each time instead of being file-based. It is local so you have all the versions on your computer and don't need a server.)
3. (Local, centralized, and distributed types of version control systems differ based on where files are kept. Local has the database of versions on your computer, centralized has the database on a server accessible to more than one, and distributed has the databases on each computer as well as the server they are all connected to.)
